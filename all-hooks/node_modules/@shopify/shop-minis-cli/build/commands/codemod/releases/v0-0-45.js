 * In v0.0.45 we removed the patches directory that existed on the rootpath of each Mini, since the CLI handles dependency patching internally.
 * (we forgot to remove this folder in v0.0.44 so Minis created using shop-minis-cli v0.0.44 would still have it)
 *
 * Diff: https://github.com/Shopify/shop-minis-cli/compare/v0.0.44...v0.0.45
